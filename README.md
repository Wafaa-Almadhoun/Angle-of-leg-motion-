## Introduction

This project talk about stick nodes of the lower part of a humanoid robot and describe the angle when robot gait forward ,
the idea here the foot have wheels but every leg will move independently without jumping or sweaning , so we calculate the angle 
were the leg move while the foot don't touch the ground hardly 


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* CINEMA 4D [To Downloud](https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d)

	
## Design parameter & Specification
    
 The maximum height of  the leg from hip to the ground  is 64 cm
